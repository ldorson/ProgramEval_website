## 1: Program theory

The HOPE scholarship program's underlying goal was to increase education in Georgia. To do this, they predetermined that providing a state-wide merit-based scholarship was the best way to achieve this. HOPE scholarship recipients have 100% of their tuition costs covered at eligible in-state institutions. Policymakers hoped that by offering this sizable financial aid, students would be incentivized to perform better in the academic environment at both the high school and college levels. With students performing better in school, there would be a higher chance of more students getting accepted into college. Also, students who perform better will feel more of a desire to pursue higher education than those who do not. To follow that, if more Georgia students have a higher chance of being accepted into college and a higher drive to pursue further education, this will lead to more college enrollment. With an increase in college enrollment overall, there is the potential for a higher number of college graduates compared to low college enrollment.Â 

To sum up, the HOPE program's underlying theory is that by offering financial support at higher education institutions within the state, students would be motivated to perform better in school. This would hopefully increase the number of Georgians receiving a college degree and simultaneously increase the overall education level in Georgia, which is the desired outcome.

#### [Inputs]{.underline}

-   Low college attainment: As mentioned earlier Georgia's percentage of students receiving a degree was well below the national average. HOPE was created to combat that.

-   Georgia students: This represents all high school and college level students. They are the potential recipients of the HOPE scholarship.

-   GA institutions: This represents all the institutions in Georgia (& some out of state) that accept the HOPE scholarship.

-   State funding: The program is funded entirely by the Georgia Lottery for Education which comes from lottery ticket revenue.

-   HOPE staff: This represents the staff that run the scholarship program financially, determine eligibility, and monitor student eligibility being maintained.

#### [Activities]{.underline}

-   HOPE scholarship offered: This is the initial scholarship that is offered to all Georgia students graduating high school and enrolled in college.

-   HOPE scholarship awarded: If a student meets the requirements, they are awarded tuition coverage.

-   Eligibility processed: HOPE staff have to determine which Georgia students meet the GPA requirements.

-   Eligibility maintained: HOPE recipients have to maintain a specific GPA requirement that must be monitored by staff.

#### [Outputs]{.underline}

-   HOPE recipients: The number of college students awarded the HOPE scholarship.

-   HOPE amount spent: The total amount of funding that was invested into HOPE scholarship recipients.

-   HOPE recipient GPAs: This represents the GPAs that HOPE recipients received in college.

#### [Outcomes]{.underline}

-   Increase in School Dedication: Students will strive to perform better in school.

-   Increase in College Enrollment: The number of Georgia students enrolled in college will increase as a result.

-   Increase in College Graduates: The number of Georgia college graduates will increase as a result as well.

-   Increase in Overall Georgian Knowledge: An overall increase in the knowledge/skills of Georgia residents. This is the main goal of the HOPE program that will hopefully be the result of the financial incentives offered to Georgia students.
