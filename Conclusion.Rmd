title: "Conclusion"

---

The findings from this analysis indicate that the HOPE scholarship was successful in increasing college attainment in Georgia. However, if an effect was not found, then the conclusion that the HOPE scholarship was not successful can be drawn. Therefore, alternative scholarship designs should be created and further tested to possibly replace the scholarship.
